# Immersive Box Office

## Concept
Immersive Box Office (IBO) is an innovative ticket sale system, that transforms ticket purchase into an interactive and immersive experience. Through the most recent technologies of 3D for the web, IBO transports the buyer into an appealing and immersive 3D environment, simplifying the purchase of tickets, through a whole new navigation and virtual reality paradigm. Simultaneously, IBO simplifies the sales system through a web-based technology: WebGL, enabling a multi-platform and compatible usage. IBO intends to solve all the usability issues with current ticket sales systems, while rendering the whole process more interesting and desirable for end customers. IBO presents a series of innovative features like a 3D interactive interface, VR experience, Immersive Advertising and Multi-Platform compatibilities. 

On top of all this, IBO is also usable as a VR conference room, allowing speakers to broadcast live videos, or play deferred videos to a series of attendants. This is made using the latest WebRTC technologies, and has unlimited potential, in the areas of education, video-conferencing, and many others.

## Tech
IBO was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) framework.
